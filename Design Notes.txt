Design Note for Autofill Disposal FOrm FP_5263_E using Excel VBA

Feature needed:
1. Look for the template via File Picker Dialogue
2. Remember where the Template is
3. Look for the output directory for saving the output files
4. Automatically transfer info from Excel to PDF
5. Attach output file & send it to designated receipient
6. Different macro for other forms in the series (move/writeoff, etc)
7. (Stretch goal) Integration with Maximo
	i. Automatically look up asset in Maximo and grab the info (Probably very hard at system level, maybe with AHK)
	ii. Manually locate the asset record and auto transfer info to Excel (Probably AHK as well)
